  "responsibleGaming": "Responsible Gaming\nWinners.bet is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its customers as well as promoting the awareness of problem gambling and improving prevention, intervention and treatment.\nWinners.bet’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment to minimizing the negative effects of problem gambling and to promoting responsible gambling practices.\nWinners.bet supports the generation of online gamblers offering them a wide range of games and entertainment. We also take responsibility for our product line-up.\nThe aim of Winners.bet is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for adults. The offered clear and safe products allow each user to play within his financial means and to receive the highest quality service. Integrity, fairness and reliability are the guiding principles of Winners.bet’s work.\nIt is therefore clear that Winners.bet should do its best to avoid and reduce the problems which can arise from participation in gambling, particularly in cases of immoderate playing.\nResponsible Gaming at Winners.bet is based on three fundamental principles:\n1. Security\nSecurity of the player, Security of the game and Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research institutes, associations and therapy institutions, we work on creation of a responsible, secure and reliable framework for online gaming.\n2. Compliance\nWe take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of the players is based on forbidding the attendance of the minors from participation in games and the protection of privacy, which involves responsible processing of personal data and payments. Fairness and the random nature of the products offered are monitored closely by independent organizations. Marketing communication is also geared towards player protection: we promise only what players can receive in our transparent line.\n3. Protection against gaming addiction: research – prevention – intervention\nThe majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation for entertainment. Certain habits and behaviour patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or consumption of alcohol) which are considered to be normal and not causing any concern can develop into addiction for some people and cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can lead to problems for a small group of customers.\nClients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation in the gaming line-up. Subsequently the customers are provided with contacts of organizations where they can receive professional advice and support.\nSelf-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention.\nThe basic principle promoted by Winners.bet is that the final decision and responsibility on whether to play or not, and how much money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the customer himself. Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective form of protection from addiction. Winners.bet sees its responsibility in assisting the customers by providing transparent products, full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.\nProtection of minors\nWinners.bet does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to participate in games and make bets. That’s why the confirmation of having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date of birth are mandatory requirements during registration. Winners.bet considers the issue of minors taking part in games and betting very seriously. In order to offer the best possible protection of minors, we also rely on the support of parents and caregivers. Please keep your data for account access in a safe place (user ID and password). Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This software will allow you to restrict the access to Internet resources inappropriate for children and teenagers.\nResponsibility towards problems\nWinners.bet offers a variety of games and bets which are forms of entertainment for the majority of customers. At the same time the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining environment taking into account the associated risks. The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer from gambling addiction are not able to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive it as a form of entertainment. Winners.bet takes responsibility for such users by blocking their access to its products for their own protection.\nGet informed with the main issues!\nMost people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within their financial capacity is fully acceptable. However, for a small percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment, it is a challenge that must be considered seriously.\nWhat is the problematic game behaviour?\nA problematic game behaviour is considered to be such behaviour which interferes mode of life, work, financial position or health of a person or his family. Long participation in games is counter-indicative to such person as it can lead to negative consequences.\nIn 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially recognized and enlisted in the list of psychological diseases of international classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined as long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for game, despite of existing negative personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and delay of professional growth.\nIn what cases behaviour of a person should be considered as dependence?\nIt is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can be qualified only by experts. The material presented on this web-page will help you to estimate and define your own game behaviour.\nThe special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any substance is that it is very difficult to define the line between pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic signals that may point out the existing problems. In the presence of at least five of the following symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:\nThe player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are only about the game.\nBet sum increases in course of time.\nAttempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to be unsuccessful.\nWhen limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences irritation and disappointment.\nThe game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.\nThe player tries to win back the lost amount,\nLies about his playing behaviour,\nCommits illegal acts,\nSpoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,\nBorrows to participate in the games.\nRules for responsible games:\nFollowing the rules placed below, you can enjoy the game without anxiety:\nStart playing only when you are calm and concentrated.\nTake regular breaks.\nDefine for yourself beforehand the monthly amount you can spend on the game.\nOnce setting a maximum limit, do not further increase it.\nBefore you start playing, define the maximum amount of winning, after reaching of which you should stop playing.\nDefine the amount you can afford to lose beforehand.\nDo not start playing under alcohol or drug influence.\nDo not start playing in a depressed state.",
